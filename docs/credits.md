- This project owes much to David DeSandro's [Masonry](http://masonry.desandro.com/), [Packery](http://packery.metafizzy.co/) and [Isotope](https://isotope.metafizzy.co/) libraries. You should go ahead and check them out right now if you haven't yet. Thanks Dave!
- Jukka Jylänki's [survey](https://github.com/juj/RectangleBinPack) "A Thousand Ways to Pack the Bin - A Practical Approach to Two-Dimensional Rectangle Bin Packing" came in handy when building Muuri's layout algorithms. Thanks Jukka!
- Big thanks to the people behind [Web Animations polyfill](https://github.com/web-animations/web-animations-js) for making it possible to use Web Animations API reliably across browsers today.
- [Haltu Oy](http://www.haltu.fi/) was responsible for initiating this project in the first place and funded the initial development. Thanks Haltu!
