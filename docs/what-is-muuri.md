# What is Muuri?

Muuri is a JavaScript layout engine that allows you to build all kinds of layouts (no kidding!) and make them responsive, sortable, filterable, draggable and/or animated. Compared to what's out there Muuri is a combination of [Packery](http://packery.metafizzy.co/), [Masonry](http://masonry.desandro.com/), [Isotope](http://isotope.metafizzy.co/) and [Sortable](https://github.com/RubaXa/Sortable). Wanna see it in action? Check out the [demo](https://muuri.dev/) on the website.

**Features**

- Fully customizable layout
- Asynchronous layout calculations in web workers
- Drag & drop (even between grids)
- Auto-scrolling during drag
